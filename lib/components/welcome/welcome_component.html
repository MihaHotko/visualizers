    <h2>Hello there,</h2>
    <p>welcome to my site. This is where I store my collection of various projects that I made. 
       The projects that are listed here were picked because I found them fun to make/study/discuss...
    </p>
    <p>The tools and frameworks that I used to build this project are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://dart.dev/" target="_blank">Dart</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://angulardart.dev/" target="_blank">AngularDart</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://animejs.com/" target="_blank">animejs</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now you are probably asking yourself why use <span class="tag">Dart</span>  and <span class="tag">AngularDart</span>... Well even I don't really know why. 
       But thgrough coding this site I found out that I really like Dart, AngularDart I could go either way because my main framework of choice is VueJs
       but alas there is no binding to VueJs from Dart</p>
    <p>
      In my mind <span class="tag">animejs</span> is the best javascript animation library period. PERIOD!!! First I tried
       to remake animejs in dart, it turned out that is really hard :( (who would have guessed). After 3 days of working
        I found out that you could use javascript libraries in dart if you bind them correctly. An article that really helped
         me is on <a target="_blank" href="https://dev.to/graphicbeacon/how-to-use-javascript-libraries-in-your-dart-applications--4mc6">Dev.to</a>
